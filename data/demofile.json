As a result small partnership schools received more annual funding than comparable state schools. Since then the model has been updated. But so have the formulae for pre-opening funding such that now partnership schools receive less money during start-up than comparable new state schools.", "To understand how all of this works, we have to delve into the details.", "Partnership schools receive three main funding lines. First is their teaching and operating grant. To ensure neutrality of funding this was originally calculated using the total salary and operating costs of all state schools. However the formula was flawed, because not many state schools are as small as partnership schools in their early years of opening.", "This meant the partnership schools that opened with small rolls in 2014, 2015 and 2016 benefited from far more in their teaching and operating grant than similar state schools.<br>\nCompounding this was the impact of guaranteed minimum rolls. These are best-estimates of a partnership school&#x2019;s annual roll used to determine yearly funding.", "Although in established state schools such estimates are usually pretty accurate, in some new partnership schools they proved to have been set too high. The effect of this was to push up their per-pupil funding above that in similar state schools.", "In response, since 2017 the rules have changed so that guaranteed minimum rolls apply only for the first year rather than the first three years, and the formula now generates an accurate match with the funding of small state schools.", "Next, partnership schools must be compensated for the fact that, unlike new state schools, they are not given premises. Instead the ministry pays partnership schools an annual property grant beginning six months before they open.", "Originally, to ensure equivalence with new state schools&#x2019; permanent buildings, the property grant was calculated based on the number of children the school would serve when full. But since 2017 this was reduced so that the property grant is now calculated annually, according only to the proposed roll for that year.", "Because they are untested, new schools rarely open with their maximum rolls. Accordingly, partnership schools now attract less property funding than before, and less than creates equivalence with new state schools. So much less in fact, that in future some partnership schools may have to open in temporary premises.", "The final part of partnership schools&#x2019; funding is their establishment grant. This covers the costs of set-up, and the principal&#x2019;s salary in the pre-opening phase.", "However, although new state schools receive the principal&#x2019;s salary for five terms before opening, partnership schools only received it for two. This finally changed last month so that it is now in line with new state schools, but still large discrepancies remain.", "New state schools attract pre-opening funding for an additional two or three senior management staff for up to a year before opening, as well as the balance of teaching staff for one term. These advantages are yet to be extended to partnership schools.", "So with some mishaps along the way, the ministry has been learning on the job how to fund partnership schools. From this year their teaching and operating grant aligns with the realities faced by small state schools. But their property and establishment grants now put them at a disadvantage.", "Before a new school opens, everything must be in place: from the content of the curriculum, to what shorts students wear for PE; from induction in kaupapa Maori to what number to call when a child is unwell. There are thousands of decisions to be made, from the everyday to the extraordinary.", "The opportunity for a principal to delegate some of these to another salaried person, let alone a team, could make a sizeable difference. Similarly, for a child from a chaotic family, the opportunity for a teacher to visit their home during the term before Christmas could make all the difference between a positive or otherwise start at their new school.", "It goes without saying that funding for state and partnership schools should be neutral.

Our little children are like sponges who soak everything up; they&#x2019;re learning everything all the time. So any time you&#x2019;re trying to apply a judgement, it can only ever be a historical snapshot. Things move on really quickly. So we report to the Ministry, and the data gets crunched into tables, but you&#x2019;re always looking at lag times of up to 12 months, on a centrally mandated set of criteria. You&#x2019;re then trying to make decisions on data that is out of date. That&#x2019;s not good practice.&#x201D;", "Colin says another problem is the lack acknowledgement of context around the standards/whanake.", "&#x201C;We know that all children learn within a socio-cultural context. So that environment, and the people they engage with, and the immense number of variables around an individual learner are significant contributors to the rate of progress in their learning, but these things are not reflected in the reporting.&#x201D;", "Colin is excited about what the changes might mean for the future of primary teaching in New Zealand.", "&#x201C;What I&#x2019;m delighted about is that <em>The New Zealand Curriculum </em>and <em>Te Marautanga o </em><em>Aotearoa,</em> both world-renowned as broad, effective and rich curriculums, can now be celebrated and delivered again across all their wonderful areas.&#x201D;", "Colin says there are plenty of assessment and reporting tools already in use in schools, including PAT, e-asTTle and JAm, among others, and his team intends to continue and expand their use across the dual mediums at Titahi Bay North School.", "&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no debate that we do need to get the basics right &#x2013; literacy and numeracy &#x2013; and primary teachers always &#x2018;go hard&#x2019; on these, but it will be wonderful to have more time to light the fire under all the other areas we&#x2019;ve not had enough time for.&#x201D;", "<strong>Lorraine Taylor is principal of Lynmore School in Rotorua.</strong> She says that while she and her team are happy to see the end of National Standards, she is also glad to see that the new Minister will keep the accompanying PaCT framework available to schools.", "PaCT is an online tool designed by the Ministry of Education to help teachers make reliable judgements on students&#x2019; progress and achievements in relation to National Standards.", "&#x201C;We are pleased to see an end to National Standards.

I believe my experiences and observations in the classroom over the past few years can validate this. I am becoming increasingly aware that it is not the standards that are the problem,&#x201D; he writes.", "&#x201C;The real problem is in the way that teachers approach learning (in general) and how they approach the achieving of those standards (specifically).&#x201D;", "Mark says the standards should not take centre stage in what a teacher does in the classroom, but rather be a by-product of effective teaching practice, and the ideology on either side is merely a distraction from the job at hand.", "&#x201C;Unfortunately, it&#x2019;s not unusual to see political decisions made on ideology and not evidence. The best outcome would be to keep National Standards and at the same time upskill teachers, but that would require investment and honest self-appraisal among teachers,&#x201D; he says.", "&#x201C;I have been teaching for quite a while &#x2013; both before the standards were introduced and after.

preyed on parents&#x2019; &#x201C;hopes and fears&#x201D; about their children&#x2019;s future to sell expensive tuition products, a court has heard.</strong>", "The Commerce Commission charged the Auckland Academy of Learning (AAL) in June last year over the way it sold education software packages, claiming that staff misrepresented the product and breached consumer credit and direct selling laws.", "Today, a sentencing hearing was heard by Judge Noel Sainsbury in the Auckland District Court after the company earlier pleaded guilty.", "The Commerce Commission had received more than 180 complaints, largely after a series of stories aired on the now-defunct TV3 programme,&#xA0;<i>Campbell Live</i>, between 2014 and 2015 over the way AAL sold computer-aided mathematic instruction (Cami) software.", "The software&#x2019;s cost ranged from $6000 to $11,000, while the price was also misrepresented in some instances.", "The Commerce Commission said the Newmarket-based company would make a cold call before being invited into people&#x2019;s homes.", "Once there, sales representatives would offer school-aged children a complimentary tutoring session, but it was a disguise for a sales pitch to sell them Cami.", "AAL&#x2019;s sales pitches would &#x201C;prey on parents&#x2019; hopes for their child&#x2019;s education for their futures&#x201D; as well as playing on the fear that the public school system was failing their children, counsel for the Commerce Commission Alysha McClintock said.", "The company would attempt sell its &#x201C;expensive product&#x201D; to parents with &#x201C;shock and scare tactics&#x201D; and commit them to a long-standing contract, she said.", "Sales scripts were also worded so that the assessment would demonstrate what the child was learning at school and if there were any &#x201C;missing concepts&#x201D;, McClintock added.", "Part of the sales script was to categorise a child as being either average, struggling, or advanced. If advanced the sales pitch would be that the software would keep them at a high level, the court heard.", "The student&#x2019;s assessment was also explained to have been from the previous academic year, with parents told any more than one or two mistakes showed &#x201C;gaps in knowledge&#x201D;, McClintock said.", "But the court heard the test was often harder and any incorrect answers were circled in red before the sales person would ask the prefaced question: &#x201C;Is this the sort of result you expected?&#x201D;", "Victims of the AAL scheme said the rort was &#x201C;gut-wrenching&#x201D; and left them &#x201C;dumbfounded&#x201D;.", "&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t get the product but you pay everything for it,&#x201D; said one in a victim impact statement.", "McClintock said it was not describing Cami as a &#x201C;worthless product&#x201D; but that it shouldn&#x2019;t have been tied to the New Zealand educational curriculum.", "The court heard that the sales people had no teaching qualifications, except one who claimed to be a teacher.", "The Commerce Commission said the company had also failed to tell parents they had a right to cancel the uninvited direct sales agreement before it was entered into, that AAL failed to disclose key information about credit provided for the software, and that the price paid was misrepresented in some cases.", "Academy of Learning is owned by its sole director, Gordon McPherson, and holds a distribution licence for the Cami software in New Zealand.", "McPherson was in court for the hearing.", "His and AAL&#x2019;s counsel Fiona McGeorge argued for a sentencing discount due to negative publicity causing a &#x201C;catastrophic&#x201D; sales dip for the company.", "However, McClintock said any bad press was simply a consequence of the offending.", "McGeorge also said the company accepts its sales representatives were not giving the correct oral advice to parents.", "But she argued that &#x201C;written advice was stronger than oral&#x201D; and the customers had signed a written contract.", "She also said the customers had the opportunity to pull out of the deal if they couldn&#x2019;t afford it or got cold feet.", "Judge Sainsbury, however, said the reality was many people don&#x2019;t read contracts when making an emotional decision &#x2013; increasing the importance of oral advice.", "&#x201C;And it doesn&#x2019;t get much more emotional when you push the button on a child&#x2019;s education &#x2026; it&#x2019;s such a charged area,&#x201D; he told McGeorge.", "&#x201C;That&#x2019;s just wrong.&#x201D;", "The judge said the parents were incredibly vulnerable, particularly if they had limited education themselves and wished nothing but the best for their children.", "Judge Sainsbury reserved his decision until later this month.", "McGeorge said if the court imposed a fine above a certain level then AAL will have to liquidate.", "Two of the Commission&#x2019;s 11 charges related to AAL&#x2019;s alleged failure to tell consumers, before the agreements were entered into, that they had a right to cancel the uninvited direct sales agreement.", "Other allegations by the Commission include that AAL failed to disclose key information about the credit provided for the Cami software programme.", "There were initially 37 charges, the court heard.", "<em><strong>Source: <a href=\"http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11945124\">NZ Herald</a></strong></em>"], "subtitle": "An Auckland educational company preyed on parents' \"hopes and fears\" about their children's future to sell expensive tuition products, a court has heard.", "title": "Auckland education company preyed on parents hopes and fears to sell products"}, {"keywords": ["kura", "principal", "awarded", "73,000", "lost", "wages", "compensation", "found", "unjustifiably", "dismissed", "Auckland", "decision", "released", "today", "ERA", "awarded", "47,564", "lost", "wages", "25,000", "humiliation", "loss", "dignity", "dismissed", "Employment Relations Authority", "Te Kura Kaupapa Maori O Puau Te Moananui A Kiwa", "failed", "obtain", "order", "permanent", "reinstatement", "ERA", "member", "difficult", "parties", "re-establishing", "trustful", "working", "relationship", "uncertainty", "regaining", "practising", "certificate", "endorsement", "kura", "board", "began", "working", "teacher", "year", "1-13", "Maori", "language", "immersion", "school", "1988", "principal", "dismissed", "September", "2015", "alleged", "inadequate", "reporting", "board", "issues", "identified", "annual", "audit", "reports", "failure", "respond", "inappropriate", "employment", "teaching", "staff", "Education Review Office", "earlier", "ERA", "decision", "objected", "statements", "made", "board", "chairman", "hui", "dismissal", "Paenga", "alleges", "Mr", "informed", "hui", "Mr", "dismissed", "misconduct", "misappropriated", "funds", "kuras", "investment", "account", "270,000", "denied", "misappropriation", "funds", "claimed", "put", "words", "mouth", "reported", "response", "ERA", "appeared", "board", "gained", "sense", "half", "2015", "sabbatical", "leave", "principal", "issues", "board", "raises", "largely", "performance", "competency", "issues", "addressed", "manner", "earlier", "decision", "finding", "unjustifiably", "dismissed", "latest", "decision", "satisfied", "lost", "substantial", "remuneration", "reimbursed", "8479.26", "remuneration", "lost", "month", "found", "job", "decreased", "pay", "received", "role", "awarded", "total", "47,564", "accepted", "Paengas", "distress", "losing", "job", "profoundly", "exacerbated", "impression", "gained", "community", "members", "hui", "dismissal", "due", "dishonesty", "Mr", "long-serving", "employee", "years", "service", "decision", "familys", "life", "intertwined", "kura", "intensively", "involved", "expansion", "kura", "role", "teacher", "tumuaki", "important", "part", "life", "self-esteem", "suffered", "due", "removal", "role", "community", "found", "blameworthy", "reduce", "remedies", "awarded", "25,000", "compensation", "Source"], "content": ["<strong>An Auckland kura principal has been awarded nearly $73,000 for lost wages and compensation after being found to have been unjustifiably dismissed.</strong>", "In its decision, released today, the Employment Relations Authority (ERA), awarded Katene Paenga $47,564 for lost wages and $25,000 for humiliation and loss of dignity after being dismissed from Te Kura Kaupapa Maori O Puau Te Moananui A Kiwa in Glen Innes.", "Paenga failed to obtain an order for permanent reinstatement because, as ERA member Nicola Craig said, it was difficult to see the parties re-establishing a trustful working relationship.", "There was also uncertainty about Paenga regaining his practising certificate without endorsement from the kura board.", "Paenga began working as a teacher at the year 1-13 Maori language immersion school in 1988 before becoming principal.", "He was dismissed in September 2015 for alleged inadequate reporting to the board;

It received $831 per student in fees last year. At the other end of the income spectrum, schools like Edmund Hillary Collegiate in Otara will gladly accept the grant. It receives no fees to give up, it does not ask for them from households that struggle to feed and clothe their children.", "A survey we have conducted of state schools suggests 70 per cent plan to accept the Government&#x2019;s proposal, which must means it is more than they normally receive from parents. Only about 20 per cent of the country&#x2019;s 2531 schools ask for no money so a 70 per cent acceptance would mean the Government&#x2019;s offer is high enough to replace the amounts most receive.", "But The Herald&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://educationcentral.co.nz/hand-to-mouth-grammar-school-needs-donations/\">feature</a> by Simon Collins today also finds that parental fees are not the only source of additional funds for some schools. Pokie trusts are another source they use to finance class trips and equipment that their operations grant from the Ministry of Education does not cover. There will always be a demand for more than the ministry provides. It is human nature.", "In state services like health and education, providers will always want to provide more, for good reason. They are professionals who want to provide the best service possible with the money available to them. The more money they have at their disposal, the more illnesses they can treat, or the more educational aids and experiences they can provide for their pupils.", "When asking parents for their annual &#x201C;donation&#x201D;, school principals always say the government grant is not sufficient to cover the education the children deserve. Of course it is not. It can never be enough. The only check on how much of any good thing we want is the price we are asked to pay. When it comes at no charge most people will readily pay for a bit more.", "That is why Labour&#x2019;s scheme to replace school fees is probably futile. The grant will be built into the schools&#x2019; basic operations and from time to time teachers will want to do new things &#x2014; take a class somewhere special, seize a rare learning opportunity too good to turn down &#x2014; that will be possible only with a parental contribution.", "Parents who refuse, steadfastly insisting education is supposed to be free &#x2014; and every state school has them, including those in well-off communities &#x2014; should think about this. Their children do not usually miss out on the extra opportunities because they should not suffer for the parents&#x2019; view. So the paying parents subsidise them.", "The Government&#x2019;s scheme, if it comes to fruition, will reinforce the views of those who refuse to pay.

move forward.&#x201D;", "Curtis, a former Auckland College of Education Primary Teacher Education director and faculty dean of the Auckland Institute of Technology, was appearing before the education select committee asking it to shelve legislation that abolishes charter schools, also known as partnership schools.", "He was joined by John Shewan, a former deputy chairman of the statutory board
